# PowerBi - Age Buckets

Variable BucketSize contains the size of the bucket.
By default the bucket size is 5 years.

There are two version of the bucket script.
The choice depends on you personal preference of how you want to display the buckets.

## version 1

0-4 years

5-9 years

10-14 years

...

## version 2

0-5 years

6-10 years

11- 15 years

...


The first bucket actually holds 6 years worth of data instead of five.
In reality a lost of datasets only an adult population and this first bucket is irrelevant.
